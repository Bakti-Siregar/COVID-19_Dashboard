# Shiny Dashbord for Tracking and modeling COVID-19 datasets

* COVOD19 is a Shiny app developed by Bakti Siregar, M.Sc, Lecturer of Data Scientist at [Matana University](https://matanauniversity.ac.id/).

* The goal is to follow the trend of the evolution of this Covid-19 pandemy and estimate when it will be safe to get back to normal life.

* The map overview shows daily confirmed, recovered , and deaths cases. The two tables quickly show us the classification of dead and confirmed cases in the countries of the world.
